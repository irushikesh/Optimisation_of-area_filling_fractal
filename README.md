# Optimisation_of-area_filling_fractal
Many researchers have used these local optimization formulae to generate the fractal trees, which have diameters based on the generation number and hierarchy of the branching structure. 
These trees are freely growing fractals where the vessel lengths were assumed to be linearly proportional to the vessel radius []. 
Mandelbrot [] came up with an idea of area feeling trees and suggested that biological branching structures might exhibit fractal-like properties. 
Much work has been carried out after that, to study the fractal nature of the vascular branching. 
Parametric Lindenmayer system (L-system) has been also used by researchers to generate the open tree structure []. 
But these methods do not take the topological data into consideration neither they have considered the corresponding mass flow rate through each branch. 
Assuming shear stress conserving branches, if the slenderness ratio (l/r) is constant, the pressure at the delivery points will be same. 
This might not be the case with optimized structure! There is a high probability that optimization principles also influence the angle and diameter selection process for arteries and arterioles but the additional functions which must be performed by vessels also effect the decision substantially. 
It has been suggested that Area Filling fractals can mimic vasculature of kidneys, lungs (organs that have progressing function) []
